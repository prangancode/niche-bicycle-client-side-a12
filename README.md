## Bullet Points :

1. It's a Bicycle Related website.  You can get all kind of cycle related information here.  This website is hosted by firebase. The server is deployed in Heroku and for database we used MongoDB

2. In the home page,  there are five parts,  banner,  all Cycles,  introduction, reviews  along with header and footer, 

3. If anyone want to book the cycles he / she have to register / login to the website.  After successful login,  you can see the details of the services and then book. 

4.  There is a private route for book now button in cycles section which is located in home page and for whice you have to login to see the details.  And,  also there is  About us route in the header. 

5.  If the user is logged in then he can see see MY orders,reviews and pay in dashboard route ,situated in sidebar section and if Admin logs in then he/she can see add a product, manage all products,make an admin and manage all order. If the admin wants then he/she can make another user admin.

6. By submitting reviews, reviews will be displayed to the home page. there is dynamic rating.

7.Admin can see all orders , can add a product or delete it and make the status of ordered product shipped.
